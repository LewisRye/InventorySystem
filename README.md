This project is my first ever project committed to GitHub, it was a homework project so I have removed all documentation in order to ensure it cannot be copied as someone else's in future. This is a project that would aid a small business in adding, removing and editing stock that they hold in their warehouse. I believe this project could be further improved by creating a shopping website for an end user that would like to purchase some of the items. Perhaps even implementing the PayPal sandbox... Maybe I will add these changes in the future if I am able to. This project is also being used with branches to help me learn more about Git and how to merge changes.
